C++17 Required

An official test PPA:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-7
gcc-7 --version
Not available in 16.10.

It looks like 17.10 will have it by default: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gcc-7

GCC 7 was release in May 2017, so too late for 17.04 main release.
